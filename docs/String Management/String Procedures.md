# String Procedures

This is a collection of assorted ready to use string procedures to manipulate FreeBasic strings and my own DWSTRING (Dynamic Unicodde string) and BSTRING (OLE strings, aka BSTR).

The procedures that need tobe fast have been hard coded, whereas the ones that need flexibility use `CRegExp`a wrapper class on top of the VBScript regular expressions engine.

[`CRegExp`](https://github.com/JoseRoca/WinFBX2/blob/main/docs/String%20Management/CRegExp%20Class.md) can also be used to build other string procedures not included in this collection.

```
^ ? Anchors the match to the start of the string.
[\+\-]? ? Matches an optional plus (+) or minus (-) sign at the beginning (for signed numbers).
\d* ? Matches zero or more digits before the decimal point (allows integers or leading zero suppression).
\.? ? Matches an optional decimal point (if present, allows floating-point numbers).
\,? ? Matches an optional decimal point (in Spain, a comma is used instead of a colon).
\d+ ? Matches at least one digit after the decimal (ensuring valid numeric values).
(?:[Ee][\+\-]?\d+)? ? Handles scientific notation:
  E or e for exponent notation.
  [\+\-]? for optional sign after the exponent indicator.
  \d+ ensures at least one digit in the exponent.
$ ? Anchors the match to the end of the string, ensuring a full numeric match.

For a complete list see: [LCMapStringEx function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winnls/nf-winnls-lcmapstringex)

#### Remarks

The string conversion functions available in FreeBasic are not fully suitable for some languages. For example, the Turkish word "karışıklığı" is uppercased as "KARıŞıKLıĞı" instead of "KARIŞIKLIĞI", and "KARIŞIKLIĞI" is lowercased to "karişikliği" instead of "karışıklığı". Notice the "ı", that is not an "i".

For Turkey, use:
```
wstrUCase("karışıklığı", "tr-TR")
wstrLCase("KARIŞIKLIĞI", "tr-TR")
```

#### Return value

The lowercased string.

```
---

### <a name="wtrlsetabs"></a>wstrLSetAbs

Left-aligns a string within the space of another string. If *wszStr* is empty, the function leaves the padding positions unchanged from their original content, rather than replacing them with spaces as `LSET` does. If *wszStr* is longer than *wszSourceString*, **wstrLSet** truncates it from the right until it fits in the result string.

Right-aligns a string within the space of another string. If *wszStr* is empty, the function leaves the padding positions unchanged from their original content, rather than replacing them with spaces as `RSET` does. If *wszStr* is longer than *wszSourceString*, **wstRSet** truncates it from the right until it fits in the result string.

```
FUNCTION wstrRSetAbs (BYREF wszSourceString AS CONST WSTRING, BYREF wszStr AS CONST WSTRING) AS DWSTRING
```

| *wszMask* | One or more character delimiters to shrink. |
| *IgnoreCase* | Boolean. If False, the search is case-sensitive; otherwise, it is case-insensitive. |

#### Remarks

This function creates a string with consecutive words separated by a consistent single character, making it easier to parse. If *wszMask* is not specified, all leading and trailing spaces are removed and all occurrences of two or more spaces are changed to a single space. If *wszMask* contains one or more characters to shrink, all the leading and trailing occurences of them are removes and all occurrences of one or more characters of the mask are replaced with the first character of the mask.

#### Usage example

```
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = wstrShrink(",,, one , two     three, four,", " ,")
' Output: "one two three four".
```
---

### <a name="wstrSplit"></a>wstrSplit

Splits a string into tokens, which are sequences of contiguous characters separated by any of the characters that are part of delimiters. Each token is added to a DWSTRING (my own dynamic Unicode string data type for FreeBasic) and delimited by a carriage return and line feed. The returned string will be parsed later to get the individual tokens.

```
FUNCTION wstrSplit (BYREF wszStr AS WSTRING, BYREF wszDelimiters AS WSTRING = " ", _

| *maxsplits* | Optional. Specifies how many splits to do. Default value is -1, which is "all occurrences" |

#### Return value

A list of tokens separated by the optional seoarator specified in *wszSeparator*.

#### Usage example

```
DIM wsz AS WSTRING * 260 = "- This, a sample string."
DIM dwsTokens AS DWSTRING = wstrSplit(wsz, " ,.-", , -1)
PRINT "len dwsTokens: ", len(dwsTokens)
PRINT dwsTokens

### <a name="wstrbase64decodea"></a>wstrBase64DecodeA

Converts the contents of a Base64 mime encoded string to an ascii string.

```
FUNCTION wstrBase64DecodeA (BYREF strData AS STRING) AS STRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *strData* | The string to decode. |

#### Return value

The decoded string on success, or a null string on failure.

#### Remaks

Base64 is a group of similar encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. The Base64 term originates from a specific MIME content transfer encoding.

Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with textual data. This is to ensure that the data remains intact without modification during transport. Base64 is used commonly in a number of applications including email via MIME, and storing complex data in XML.

If we want to encode a unicode string, we must convert it to utf8 before calling AfxBase64EncodeA, e.g.

````
DIM dws AS DWSTRING = "おはようございます – Good morning!"
DIM s AS STRING = wstrBase64EncodeA(dws.Utf8)
````

To decode it, we can use

````
DIM dwsOut AS dwsTRING = DWSTRING(wstrBase64DecodeA(s), CP_UTF8)
````
or
```
DIM dwsOut AS DWSTRING
dws.utf8 = wstrBase64DecodeA(s)
```

### <a name="wstrcryptbinarytostring"></a>wstrCryptBinaryToString

Converts an array of bytes into a formatted string.

```
FUNCTION FUNCTION wstrCryptBinaryToStringA ( _
   BYVAL pbBinary AS CONST UBYTE PTR, _
   BYVAL cbBinary AS DWORD, _
   BYVAL dwFlags AS DWORD, _
   BYVAL pszString AS LPSTR, _
   BYVAL pcchString AS DWORD PTR _
) AS WINBOOL
```

```
FUNCTION wstrCryptBinaryToStringW ( _
   BYVAL pbBinary AS CONST UBYTE PTR, _
   BYVAL cbBinary AS DWORD, _
   BYVAL dwFlags AS DWORD, _
   BYVAL pszString AS LPWSTR, _
   BYVAL pcchString AS DWORD PTR _
) AS WINBOOL
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *pbBinary* | A pointer to the array of bytes to be converted into a string. |
| *cbBinary* | The number of elements in the *pbBinary* array. |
| *dwFlags* | Specifies the format of the resulting formatted string. |
| *pszString* | A pointer to a buffer that receives the converted string. To calculate the number of characters that must be allocated to hold the returned string, set this parameter to NULL. The function will place the required number of characters, including the terminating NULL character, in the value pointed to by *pcchString*. |
| *pcchString* | A pointer to a DWORD variable that contains the size, in characters, of the *pszString* buffer. If *pszString* is NULL, the function calculates the length of the return string (including the terminating null character) in characters and returns it in this parameter. If *pszString* is not NULL and big enough, the function converts the binary data into a specified string format including the terminating null character, but *pcchString* receives the length in characters, not including the terminating null character. |

Values available for the *dwFlags* parameter:

| Value      | Meaning |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| CRYPT_STRING_BASE64HEADER | Base64, with certificate beginning and ending headers. |
| CRYPT_STRING_BASE64 | Base64, without headers. |
| CRYPT_STRING_BINARY | Pure binary copy. |
| CRYPT_STRING_BASE64REQUESTHEADER | Base64, with request beginning and ending headers. |
| CRYPT_STRING_HEX | Hexadecimal only. |
| CRYPT_STRING_HEXASCII | Hexadecimal, with ASCII character display. |
| CRYPT_STRING_BASE64X509CRLHEADER | Base64, with X.509 CRL beginning and ending headers. |
| CRYPT_STRING_HEXADDR | Hexadecimal, with address display. |
| CRYPT_STRING_HEXASCIIADDR | Hexadecimal, with ASCII character and address display. |
| CRYPT_STRING_HEXRAW | A raw hexadecimal string. Not supported in Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP. |
| CRYPT_STRING_STRICT | Enforce strict decoding of ASN.1 text formats. Some ASN.1 binary BLOBS can have the first few bytes of the BLOB incorrectly interpreted as Base64 text. In this case, the rest of the text is ignored. Use this flag to enforce complete decoding of the BLOB. Not suported in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP. |

In addition to the values above, one or more of the following values can be specified to modify the behavior of the function.

| Value      | Meaning |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| CRYPT_STRING_NOCRLF | Do not append any new line characters to the encoded string. The default behavior is to use a carriage return/line feed (CR/LF) pair (0x0D/0x0A) to represent a new line. Not supported in Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP. |
| CRYPT_STRING_NOCR | Only use the line feed (LF) character (0x0A) for a new line. The default behavior is to use a CR/LF pair (0x0D/0x0A) to represent a new line. |

#### Return value

If the function succeeds, the function returns nonzero (CTRUE).
If the function fails, it returns zero (FALSE).

#### Remarks

With the exception of when **CRYPT_STRING_BINARY** encoding is used, all strings are appended with a new line sequence. By default, the new line sequence is a CR/LF pair (0x0D/0x0A). If the *dwFlags* parameter contains the **CRYPT_STRING_NOCR** flag, then the new line sequence is a LF character (0x0A). If the *dwFlags* parameter contains the **CRYPT_STRING_NOCRLF** flag, then no new line sequence is appended to the string.

In many cases, these will be the same flags that were passed in the *dwFlags* parameter. If *dwFlags* contains one of the flags inicated below, this value will receive a flag that indicates the actual format of the string. This parameter is optional and can be NULL if it is not needed. |

Values available for the *dwFlags* parameter:

| Value      | Meaning |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| CRYPT_STRING_BASE64HEADER | Base64, with certificate beginning and ending headers. |
| CRYPT_STRING_BASE64 | Base64, without headers. |
| CRYPT_STRING_BINARY | Pure binary copy. |
| CRYPT_STRING_BASE64REQUESTHEADER | Base64, with request beginning and ending headers. |
| CRYPT_STRING_BASE64 | Base64, without headers. |
| CRYPT_STRING_HEX | Hexadecimal only. |
| CRYPT_STRING_HEXASCII | Hexadecimal, with ASCII character display. |
| CRYPT_STRING_BASE64_ANY | Tries the following, in order: CRYPT_STRING_BASE64HEADER, CRYPT_STRING_BASE64. |
| CRYPT_STRING_ANY | Tries the following, in order: CRYPT_STRING_BASE64HEADER, CRYPT_STRING_BASE64, CRYPT_STRING_BINARY. |
| CRYPT_STRING_HEX_ANY | Tries the following, in order: CRYPT_STRING_HEXADDR, CRYPT_STRING_HEXASCIIADDR, CRYPT_STRING_HEX, CRYPT_STRING_HEXRAW, CRYPT_STRING_HEXASCII. |
| CRYPT_STRING_HEX | Hexadecimal only. |
| CRYPT_STRING_BASE64X509CRLHEADER | Base64, with X.509 CRL beginning and ending headers. |
| CRYPT_STRING_HEXADDR | Hexadecimal, with address display. |
| CRYPT_STRING_HEXASCIIADDR | Hexadecimal, with ASCII character and address display. |
| CRYPT_STRING_HEXRAW | A raw hexadecimal string. Not supported in Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP. |
| CRYPT_STRING_STRICT | Enforce strict decoding of ASN.1 text formats. Some ASN.1 binary BLOBS can have the first few bytes of the BLOB incorrectly interpreted as Base64 text. In this case, the rest of the text is ignored. Use this flag to enforce complete decoding of the BLOB. Not suported in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP. |

### <a name="wstrscanforsurrogates"></a>wstrScanForSurrogates

Scans a UTF-16 buffer (passed as a pointer to WSTRING) in chunks of 64 characters. Returns the 0-based index (relative to *memAddr*) of the first broken surrogate found, or -1 if none is found.

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *memAddr* | Pointer to the passes UTF-16 buffer. |
| *nChars* | Number of UTF-16 code units (USHORTs) to scan. |
| *searchBrokenOnly* |  Optional (default TRUE): if True, only broken surrogates are signaled. If False, returns the position of the first surrogate (valid or not).  |
